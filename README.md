## React Questions & Answers

### 1. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?

Ans: JSX is a syntax that lets us write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It makes React components easier to write and understand.

### 2. What is the difference between props and state?

Ans: Props are used to pass data from a parent to a child component. State is used to store data that can change inside a component.

### 3. What does the useState hook do, and where did you use it in this project?

Ans: The useState hook is used to store and update changing data in a component. I used it to store the selected technology IDs and update the stack when a user adds or removes a technology.

### 4. What does the useEffect hook do, and why did you need it to load the JSON data?

Ans: The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects after a component renders. I used it to load the JSON data when the component starts.

### 5. Why does every item in a .map() list need a unique key prop?

Ans: Every item needs a unique key so React can identify each item and efficiently update the list when something changes.

### 6. What is conditional rendering? Show one place you used it.

Ans: Conditional rendering means showing different UI based on a condition. I used it to show an empty stack message when no technology is selected.

Example:

```tsx
{selectedIds.length === 0 && (
  <p>Your stack is empty.</p>
)}
```

### 7. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component, and how does a child send something back to the parent?

Ans: We pass data from a parent to a child using props. To send something back, the parent passes a function as a prop, and the child calls that function.# b14-a5-DevStack-main
# b14-a5-DevStack-main
